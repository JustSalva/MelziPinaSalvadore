This document provides a baseline for the project planning of Travlendar+, the system we want to develop. It analyses the environment in which the system is intended to be used and contains information about the offered functions.
\newline
\newline
The application wants to be a useful tool that can be used both in work time and in free time, helping people to organize daily appointments and travels between them.
\newline
\newline
Travlendar+ is a sort of online calendar: it substitutes the standard old agenda, where in the past you were used to circle important days and write down event in order to remember them, and enhances it, bringing together various useful utilities that otherwise you would be forced to use separately.
\newline
People currently use different services, provided by calendar and maps applications, in order to organize meetings and events. Travlendar+ includes all these useful functionalities in the same application, helping you planning the day.
