\subsection{Goals}
Travlendar+ is a service based on a mobile application and a web application.
\newline
\newline
The user simply has to create events and insert them into his schedule; the application will then organize travels in order to reach locations in the best way, correctly inserting them within the daily schedule and notifying eventual overlappings. \newline
The user can modify the schedule with any feasible combination of added events and can specify different types of preferences on travel means, so the system can plan the trip according to his personal needs.
\newline
\newline
The main functionality of the system is to control the user's daily flow of events, helping him optimizing his time and making sure that all his preferences and constraints are respected.
The principal goal of Travlendar+ is to save time, both in the construction of the schedule and in the traveling between events.
