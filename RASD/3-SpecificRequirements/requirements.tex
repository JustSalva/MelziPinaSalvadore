	\newline
	\item[[R10]] every proposed path must be feasible in the available time (the interval between two consecutive events);
	\item[[R11]] if the travel involves more than one travel mean, starting location of the first proposed path and ending location of the last proposed path must coincide with starting and ending location of the whole planned travel;
	\item[[R12]] the system does not consider paths that violate constraints on travel means defined by the user;
	\item[[R13]] the system checks user preferences to decide which is the best path;
	\item[[R14]] the system warns the user if it isn’t possible arrive at the location before the event to attend starts;
	\item[[R15]] appropriate travel means must be suggested according to the type of event that they are related to; 
	\item[[R16]] if a strike occurs the system won’t consider involved travel means;
	\item[[R17]] if it rains the system won’t consider paths involving the bicycle.
	\end{description}
\item[[G5]] change the selected path with an alternative path:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D7]] a person can travel only on one travel mean at once; 
	\item[[D8]] allowed travel means are cars, trains, metro, on foot, trams, bicycles, taxis, car sharing, bike sharing;
	\item[[D9]] every travel is programmed with a combination of one or more travel means;
	\newline
	\item[[R18]] the system must show to the user all possibilities to reach a location in according with the requirements of [[G4]];
	\item[[R19]] the system allows the user to change the path only if doesn’t generate overlapping with events added later to the involved one.
	\end{description}
\item[[G6]] obtain a daily schedule that allows to attend to every event in program:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D10]] a person can be only in one place at once;
	\newline
	\item[[R20]] the combination of the paths proposed for the day must be feasible in the allotted time;
	\item[[R21]] if there are multiple events at the same time the system will propose in the schedule only the first event added.
	\item[[R22]] if the user forces into the schedule an event that overlaps with events present in the schedule, these are removed from the schedule.
	\end{description}
\item[[G7]] apply constraints on travel means:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D7]] a person can travel only on one travel mean at once; 
	\item[[D8]] allowed travel means are cars, trains, metro, on foot, trams, bicycles, taxis, car sharing, bike sharing;	
	\item[[D9]] every travel is programmed with a combination of one or more travel means;
	\newline
	\item[[R23]] the system requires min/max length allowed for a path to impose a constraint on a travel mean;
	\item[[R24]] the system requires an interval of time allowed to impose a constraint on a travel mean;
	\item[[R25]] the system doesn’t consider solutions that violate constrains.
	\end{description}
\item[[G8]] deactivate one or more travel means:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D7]] a person can travel only on one travel mean at once; 
	\item[[D8]] allowed travel means are cars, trains, metro, on foot, trams, bicycles, taxis, car sharing, bike sharing;	
	\item[[D9]] every travel is programmed with a combination of one or more travel means;
	\newline
	\item[[R26]] the system allows the user to specify one or more travel means that can’t be used.
	\item[[R27]] the system doesn’t consider solutions that include deactivated travel means.
	\end{description}
\item[[G9]] select combinations of transportation means that minimize carbon footprint:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D11]] all travel means are related to information about average carbon footprints; 
	\newline
	\item[[R28]] for each path, the system estimates carbon footprint produced.
	\end{description}
\item[[G10]] reserve time for lunch or break events:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D12]] flexible timeslots can have a daily or periodical validity;
	\item[[D13]] every flexible timeslot has a minimum amount of time that must be reserved;
	\newline
	\item[[R29]] the system allows the user to specify a flexible interval and a minimum amount of time to schedule a break;
	\item[[R30]] if there is enough time for a break, the system reserves it within the specified flexible interval;
	\item[[R31]] if there isn’t enough time into the flexible interval specified a warning is thrown.
	\end{description}
\item[[G11.1]] arrange trips/buy needed tickets:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D14]] to use a public transport a ticket is required; 
	\item[[D15]] a ticket may have a daily validity or a different periodicity; 
	\item[[D16]] user can own day/week/season passes;
	\newline
	\item[[R32]] the system allows the user to specify all the ticket he owns;
	\item[[R33]] the system shows to the user if he holds a ticket for a proposed travel;
	\item[[R34]] the system allows the user to buy public transportation tickets according to proposed travel;
	\item[[R35]] the system provides information about time of departure and arrival of the proposed travels.
	\end{description}
\item[[G11.2]] arrange trips/find available sharing vehicle:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D17]] to use a sharing vehicle a payment is required;
	\item[[D18]] a sharing vehicle must be parked in an allowed position;
	\newline
	\item[[R36]] the system shows to the user where sharing vehicles are located;
	\item[[R37]] the system provides information about travel time with shared vehicles.
