	\end{description}
\item[[G4]] obtain the best travel path (according to his preferences) and the list of eventual feasible alternatives to reach a location:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D7]] a person can travel only on one travel mean at once; 
	\item[[D8]] allowed travel means are cars, trains, metro, on foot, trams, bicycles, taxis, car sharing, bike sharing;

	\item[[R11]] if the travel involves two or more travel means, the starting location of the first proposed travel path and the ending location of the last proposed travel path must coincide respectively with the starting location and the ending location of the whole planned travel;
	\item[[R12]] the system does not consider paths that violate constraints on travel means defined by the user;
	\item[[R13]] the system checks user preferences to decide which feasible travel path is the best;
	\item[[R14]] the system warns the user if it is not possible to arrive at an event location before its starting time;
	\item[[R15]] appropriate travel means must be suggested according to the type of event that they are related to; 
	\item[[R16]] if a strike occurs, the system will not consider travel means involved in it;
	\item[[R17]] if the weather forecasts rain or other adverse conditions, the system will not consider paths involving the bicycle.
	\end{description}
\item[[G5]] change the selected path with an alternative one:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D7]] a person can travel only on one travel mean at once; 
	\item[[D8]] allowed travel means are cars, trains, metro, on foot, trams, bicycles, taxis, car sharing, bike sharing;
	\item[[D9]] every travel is programmed with a combination of one or more travel means;
	\newline
	\item[[R18]] the system must show to the user all possibilities to reach a location in according with the requirements of [[G4]];
	\item[[R19]] alternative feasible travel paths must not generate overlappings with other events of the schedule.
	\end{description}
\item[[G6]] obtain a daily schedule that allows him to attend every event in program:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D10]] a person can be only in one place at once;
	\newline
	\item[[R20]] the combination of the travel paths proposed for the day must be feasible in the allotted time;
	\item[[R21]] if there are multiple events at the same time the system will propose in the schedule only the first event added.
	\item[[R22]] if the user forces into the schedule an event that overlaps with events already present in the schedule, these are removed from the schedule.
	\end{description}
\item[[G7]] apply constraints on travel means:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D7]] a person can travel only on one travel mean at once; 
	\item[[D8]] allowed travel means are cars, trains, metro, on foot, trams, bicycles, taxis, car sharing, bike sharing;	
	\item[[D9]] every travel is programmed with a combination of one or more travel means;
	\newline
	\item[[R23]] the system requires minimum and maximum length allowed for a path to impose a constraint on a travel mean;
	\item[[R24]] the system requires an interval of time allowed to impose a constraint on a travel mean;
	\item[[R25]] the system does not consider solutions that violate constraints.
	\end{description}
\item[[G8]] deactivate one or more travel means:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D7]] a person can travel only on one travel mean at once; 
	\item[[D8]] allowed travel means are cars, trains, metro, on foot, trams, bicycles, taxis, car sharing, bike sharing;	
	\item[[D9]] every travel is programmed with a combination of one or more travel means;
	\newline
	\item[[R26]] the system allows the user to specify one or more travel means that cannot be used.
	\item[[R27]] the system does not consider solutions that include deactivated travel means.
	\end{description}
\item[[G9]] select combinations of transportation means that minimize carbon footprint:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D11]] every travel mean is related to information about its average carbon footprints;
	\newline
	\item[[R28]] for each travel path, the system estimates its carbon footprint produced.
	\end{description}
\item[[G10]] reserve time for lunch or break events:
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D12]] a flexible time-slot can have a daily or periodical validity;
	\item[[D13]] a flexible time-slot has a minimum amount of time that must be reserved;
	\newline
	\item[[R29]] the system allows the user to specify a flexible interval and a minimum amount of time to schedule a break;
	\item[[R30]] if there is enough time for a break, the system reserves it within the specified flexible interval;
	\item[[R31]] if there is not enough time into the flexible interval specified, a warning is thrown.
	\end{description}
\item[[G11.1]] arrange trips (buy needed tickets):
	\begin{description}
	\item[[D14]] a ticket is required to use a public transport;
	\item[[D15]] a ticket may have a daily validity or a different periodicity;
