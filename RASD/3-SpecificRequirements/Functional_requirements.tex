\subsection{Scenarios}
\label{subsect:Scenarios}
	\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
		Oscar is a businessman who travels a lot and he would like to organize his travels quickly and precisely. A friend advises him to try Travlendar+. Oscar accesses the Travlendar+ website and loads the registration page by clicking on the 'Sign Up' button. Then he fills all the mandatory fields, clicks on the 'Confirm' button and he receives a confirmation e-mail. He clicks on the confirmation link inside.
Finally Oscar logs in and starts using Travlendar+.
	\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
		Nigel lives in Milan and tomorrow he's going to have an appointment in Lecco, so he has to decide how to reach his appointment location; Nigel accesses the login page from his personal computer by using his browser, fills the username and password fields, clicks on the 'Confirm' button and logs in. After that, he clicks on the dedicated button to add a new event, he fills all the requested fields, setting the event type as 'work meeting' in order to obtain proper suggested travel means, then he confirms the event creation. On the next day, Nigel travels to Lecco, following the travel schedule proposed by his Travlendar+ app and reaching his appointment right on time.
	\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
		Jasper inserts an event into his Travlendar+ calendar, but the location inserted is too far away from his previous event, therefore a feasible path to reach the location of the next event is not available in the allotted time. Jasper is notified by a warning that he will not be able to reach his appointment in time.	
	\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
		Ophelia inserts a new event into his Travlendar+ calendar, but that event overlaps with another already existing event. Ophelia is notified by her app and the system asks Ophelia to choose which one of the overlapping events she wants to attend. She chooses the last event inserted, then she reads the travel means proposed to respect her new time schedule.
	\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
		Henrietta wants to personalize her Travlendar+ experience, so she clicks on the 'Menu' icon and then the voice 'Preferences'. She selects her preferred travel means, she chooses to always obtain the fastest path and then, since she walks with a limp, she inserts a maximum walking distance of 500 meters. Before clicking on the 'Confirm' button, she sees a polluting truck outside her window, so she decides to always follow travel paths that minimize her carbon footprint. She selects the relative option in her preferences. Finally she clicks on the 'Confirm' button and she observes that her suggested travels have changed according to her new preferences.
	\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
		Arthur can\textsc{\char13}t concentrate on his work if he doesn't eat his lunch between 12.00 and 13.00. He also needs at least 25 minutes to consume a proper lunch.
For this reason Arthur inserts a flexible break event into his Travlendar+ calendar, in order to be sure that every day his app will reserve a time-slot for his lunch.
A week later, Arthur inserts a new event whose travel overlaps with his flexible lunch event and his app notifies him. Arthur decides to ignore the warning, since he'll s going to eat during his travel.
	\subsubsection{Scenario 7}
		Gwendolyn looks at her Travlendar+ app and discovers that on the next day she has to travel first by train to Milan and then take a bike of MoBike’s sharing system in Milan. She clicks on the train travel slot in order to buy the proper ticket and the apps redirects her in the right Trenord’s online shop webpage. When she is about to buy the ticket she suddenly remembers that she has a weekly Trenord pass, therefore she cancels the transaction and, in order to avoid making the same mistake twice, she adds her pass information into her Travlendar+ app. The next day Gwendolyn takes the train to Milan and when she arrives she opens her Travlendar+ app in order to find the nearest bike of MoBike’s. Gwendoline arrives in time at her appointment.
	\subsubsection{Scenario 8}
		Harvey has to reach an appointment near his home next week. He adds an event in his Travlendar+ calendar. He observes that the app suggests him to use a bike to reach the location of this event. The day before his appointment the weather forecasts rain for the successive day, so Harvey is notified by his app that, due to the forecast, he should avoid taking the bike, suggesting instead to reach his appointment by car.
	\subsubsection{Scenario 9}
		Sara inserts an event in her Travlendar+ calendar, then she looks at the proposed travel path. Since she did not like the proposed travel, she clicks on the proposed path and selects another feasible alternative. The next day Sara travels according to the travel path she likes more.
