The task that should take up most of the computational time is the management of the schedule, which happens every time an event gets added, modified or deleted. To avoid slowing down the phone of the user, this computation should be done server side, sending only the result to the user.
\newline
Changing screens should occur quickly because of the light weight of the computation required to do so.
\newline
Barring eventual malfunctions of the external services implemented in the system and depending on the signal strength of the user's phone, 95\% of the server updates should take at most 2 seconds, since the internet connection used by the users is not part of the system-to-be, network delays are not considered into our performance constraints.
Travlendar+ will not impose any limit to the number of registered users.
The system must support simultaneously at least 1000 users (logged into the system).
