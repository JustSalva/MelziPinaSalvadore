In order to better define clear boundaries for developing the system, functions that  will or will not be offered by the system will be explained in this section.

\subsection{Registration and login}
The system will allow visitors to register and perform a login in order to utilize the system functionalities.

\subsection{Event insertion}
The system will allow the user to insert events, letting him define details and constraints on them.

\subsection{Schedule management}
The system will automatically manage the user's schedule respecting all his preferences and constraints added. 
\newline
Events inserted by the user must always be visible, even those that are not inserted in the regular schedule because of overlaps, allowing the user to view and manage them. Under no circumstances an event can be deleted, except for a direct order of the user.
\newline
If an event is modified or deleted, the system must adjourn the schedule to assure that efficiency is maintained.

\subsection{Travel means}
The system allows the user to apply constraints on travel means.
\newline
If a ticket to use a travel mean is needed, the system redirects the user the travel means provider's website.
