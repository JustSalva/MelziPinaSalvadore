The system will be developed from scratch and will implement these external services:
\begin{itemize}
\item feasible travels will be selected and elaborated according to the user preferences using the services provided by Google Maps APIs, eventually also using google traffic models to provide the most possible accurate travel times;
\item the acquisition of tickets will be permitted by giving access to the websites of transport means providers;
\item travel means will be proposed taking into account also the weather forecast provided by external weather APIs;
\item all feasible travels that comprehend using public travel means will take into account GTFS and GTFS-Realtime feeds, provided by Google Transit APIs and eventually by Transport Service Providers proprietary APIs.
\end{itemize}
