It also describe the structure of the code, the adopted development frameworks, the installation instructions, and information on how we have performed our tests.
Finally this document describe how our software is to be installed and which software tools we've used to develop our system.
This document is addressed to those who will have to validate and also evaluate our implementation of Travlendar+.
