We have used:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Junit} in order to test single classes of our project that do not contain DB dependencies or injected elements. With Junit we can test single functionalities, both in general and borderline cases, and find errors in quite a short time;
\item \textit{Arquillan} in order to test the integration of the JPA entity classes with a test database, to check that their interaction with the database works properly; these tests allow us to check that every modification we perform on the entity classes work properly; 
\item \textit{Mockito} in order to "mock" (simulate) functionalities of components that are yet tested or that will be tested in a different moment. The possibilities offered by function-mocking are very useful if you want to test particular instructions in the code or specific execution cases. In the project we used Mockito in order to simulate the functions offered by different EJBs. It is not commonly used for the purpose we pursued, for this reason it has been quite challenging to find a way in which to configure properly the test environment. 
\end{itemize}
