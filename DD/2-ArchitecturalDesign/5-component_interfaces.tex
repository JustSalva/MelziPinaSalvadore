We classify our interfaces in two types: the (internal) interfaces, used by the components of the application server in order to interact with each other, and the external interfaces, offered with as \textit{RESTful web services}, as specified in the previous sections. For the sake of accurateness and clarity we'll specify for each \textit{RESTful} method the relative \textit{HTTP} reference request method ( \textit{GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT} and \textit{PATCH}).

\subsection{INotificationManager}
\label{subsect:INotificationManager}
\textit{INotificationManager} provide methods to be used by the Application server components in order to send notifications to the user's mobile applications. At this stage we've identified these three methods:
\begin{itemize}
