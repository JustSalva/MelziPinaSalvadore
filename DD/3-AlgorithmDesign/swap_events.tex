The purpose of this algorithm is to check and manage the schedule when an overlapping event is forced into it, maintaining thus a feasible list of scheduled events. \\ \\
To explain it we will use the following terms: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{ForcedEvent}: the event that is going to be put into the schedule;
	\item \textit{ScheduledEvent}: an event that will be removed from the schedule as a consequence of the ForcedEvent insertion;
	\item \textit{ScheduleList}: a list containing all the scheduled events for a specific day;
	\item \textit{OverlappingList}: a list containing all the overlapping events for a specific day.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\noindent The algorithm works in this way:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Checks if there are \textit{ScheduledEvents} with: \\\\ \textit{startingTime(ScheduledEvent) \textless endingTime(ForcedEvent)} \\ and \\ \textit{startingTime(ForcedEvent) \textless endingTime(ScheduledEvent)} \\\\
	If the condition results True for one or more scheduled events, it removes them from the schedule and puts them in the \textit{OverlappingList};
	\item Computes the possible travels before and after the \textit{ForcedEvent}, depending on the information inserted about event location and departure location, and eventually depending also on previous and following existing events into the schedule;
	\item If the travel used to reach the \textit{ForcedEvent} requires a time that is greater than the available time, the previous \textit{ScheduledEvent} is removed from the \textit{ScheduleList} and added to the \textit{OverlappingList}. \underline{Repeat 2};
	\item Else if the travel used to reach the event after the \textit{ForcedEvent} in the schedule requires a time that is greater than the available time, the \textit{following ScheduledEvent} is removed from the \textit{ScheduleList} and added to the \textit{OverlappingList}. \underline{Repeat 2};
	\item Else if it is not possible to find a combination of paths (before and after the \textit{ForcedEvent}) such that the minimum amount of free time for an involved \textit{break event} can be ensured, the break event is removed from the \textit{ScheduleList} and added to the \textit{OverlappingList}. \underline{Repeat 2};
	\item Else it is the case in which at least one feasible path combination is found: the best one, according to user preferences, can be chosen and assigned to related events;
	\item \textit{ForcedEvent} has been successfully inserted in the schedule. Database is updated with all the modifications made on userâ€™s events.
\end{enumerate}
