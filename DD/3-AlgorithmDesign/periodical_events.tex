The purpose of this algorithm is to manage the creation of periodical events. \\ \\
The algorithm works in this way: when a periodical event is inserted, a number of events is generated in order to cover a span of one year, e.g. if an event like "Friday lunch with parents" with a weekly periodicity is created, 52 different events will be created.
To better understand the reasoning behind this, take a look at section \ref{sect:Other design decisions}.
