The purpose of this algorithm is to check if a flexible break inserted is respected by the events present in the schedule. \\ \\
To explain it we will use the following terms: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{BreakList}: a list containing all the events that overlap, even partially, with the flexible break time slot;
\end{itemize}
The algorithm works in this way:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Puts in BreakList all the scheduled events that take place during the allotted break time slot, even if partially;
	\item Checks if at least one of the spare time slots between an event of BreakList and the following one (including travels) is larger enough to include the break event;
\end{enumerate}	
SPECIAL CASE: if only one event is present in BreakList, the algorithm must check that the remaining spare time in the slot is larger enough to allocate the break event.
