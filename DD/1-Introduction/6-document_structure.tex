This Design Document is composed by eight parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first part is an introduction to DD and contains also other information: definition of the used terms, revision history of the document and references;
\item The second part is dedicated to the architecture of the system. In this section is given a description of different components, providing information on their deployment, on the offered functionalities and on the interaction between them.
