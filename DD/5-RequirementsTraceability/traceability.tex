		& \textbf{[R7]} the system warns the user if the inserted event overlaps with an already existing one;\\
		& \textbf{[R8]} if the ending time of an event is not specified, the systems considers as ending time the hour of departure for the successive event;\\
		& \textbf{[R9]} when an event is inserted after an event without a specified ending time, the ending time  of the first event is anticipated as stated in [R8];\\

		& \textbf{[R8]} if the ending time of an event is not specified, the systems considers as ending time the hour of departure for the successive event;\\
		& \textbf{[R9]} when an event is inserted after an event without a specified ending time, the ending time  of the first event is anticipated as stated in [R8];\\
		& \textbf{[R14]} the system warns the user if it is not possible to arrive at an event location before its starting time;\\
		& \textbf{[R19]} alternative feasible travel paths must not generate overlappings with other events of the schedule;\\

The \textit{Notification Manager} is used to satisfy the above requirements and also to warn the user when a strike is announced or when the weather forecasts for the following days are adverse.\\\\
The \textit{Persistence Manager} allows the system to interact with database and helps the system to keep up-to-date the local database. In order to perform any operation concerning the data, the system queries and updates the server database. Information about events and paths are stored also in the local database of mobile phones: in this way the mobile app doesn't require a connection to show user's schedules.
