We tried to install what was given to us, following the installation guide present in the ImplementationDocument.pdf document. \\ \\
We used XAMPP on Windows and these are the issues we found:
\begin{itemize}
	\item is it not clear what files needs to be added to the locations specified, e.g. neither the database file location nor the database file name is specified;
	\item the URL given is wrong, it should not be 'localhost/-Travlendar', but 'localhost/Travlendar';
	\item the guide is not really straightforward, the instructions about how to start XAMPP are too generic;
	\item it is written to add the database to PhpMyAdmin before actually explaining how the XAMPP server is actually started.
\end{itemize}
